# Predicting Heart Disease
This project uses machine learning to predict heart disease using a dataset of 300 records containing 13 independent variables (such as age, gender, cp, trestbps, chol, thal) for each participant.

## Analysis
The analysis consists of the following steps:

  1. Exploratory data analysis
  2. Data cleaning
  3. Data visualization
  4. Model development

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used for the analysis:

  - KNeighbors
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Python
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
## Results

After developing and comparing the models, the following accuracies were obtained:

KNeighbors: 84.48%
Decision Tree: 78.51%
Random Forest: 83.82%
Among all methods, KNeighbors had the highest accuracy (84.48%).
