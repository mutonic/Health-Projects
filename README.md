## Predicting heart disease using machine learning
- This analysis uses a dataset of 300 records containing 13 independent variables (such as age, gender, cp, trestbps, chol, thal) for each participant.
- I performed exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization, and developed a variety of models to determine whether or not an individual has heart disease.
- KNeighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used for the analysis.
- KNeighbors has an accuracy of 84.48%, Decision Tree has an accuracy of 78.51%, and Random Forest has an accuracy of 83.82%. Among all methods, KNeighbors had the highest accuracy (84.48%).

## Prediction of diabetes using machine learning
- The dataset contains 2,000 records and each record contains 8 features.
- They analyzed and cleaned the data, developed visual analysis tools, and developed several models to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.
- The best accuracy achieved was 99% with Random Forest Algorithm
- The following algorithms and technologies were used in this project: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
